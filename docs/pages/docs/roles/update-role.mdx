# `updateRole`

---

#### Description

The `updateRole` method is designed to update an existing role in the database with new details. The role to be updated is identified by the `roleId` parameter. The method allows you to change the name of the role and its associated permissions.

#### Parameters

- `roleId` (String): The identifier of the role to be updated. This should correspond to a valid `_id` value of a role in the database.
- `name` (String): The new name to assign to the role.
- `permissionIds` (Array of Objects): An array containing objects that represent permissions to be associated with the role. Each object should have the following structure:
  - `grant` (String): The name of the grant.
  - `read` (Boolean): Permission to read.
  - `write` (Boolean): Permission to write.
  - `update` (Boolean): Permission to update.
  - `delete` (Boolean): Permission to delete.

#### Returns

- Returns a Promise that resolves to the updated role object if the operation is successful. The updated role object will reflect the changes made.

#### Errors

- Throws a `HajarError` with message "Role not found" and error code "role-not-found" if no role is found with the specified `roleId`.
- Any other errors encountered during the operation will also throw a `HajarError` with the respective error message.

#### Behavior

1. The method starts by attempting to find a role in the database with the specified `roleId` using `this.Role.findById(roleId)`.
2. If no role is found, it throws a `HajarError` with the message "Role not found" and error code "role-not-found".
3. If a role is found, it proceeds to update the role's `name` field with the new name provided.
4. It initializes an empty array `idPermissions` to hold the `_id` values of the permissions to be associated with the role.
5. It iterates through the `permissionIds` array, and for each permission object, it attempts to find a corresponding permission in the database based on the `grant`, `read`, `write`, `update`, and `delete` fields using `this.Permission.findOne()`.
6. It adds the `_id` of each found permission to the `idPermissions` array.
7. It updates the `permissions` field of the role with the array of `_id` values collected in `idPermissions`.
8. It saves the updated role object to the database using `role.save()`.
9. It returns the updated role object.

#### Usage

```javascript
const hajarAuth = new HajarAuth(options);
const updatedRole = await hajarAuth.updateRole(roleId, name, permissionIds);
```

Here, `options` would be an object containing necessary configurations and dependencies, `roleId` is the identifier of the role to be updated, `name` is the new name for the role, and `permissionIds` is an array of permission objects to be associated with the role.
