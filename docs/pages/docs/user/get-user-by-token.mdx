# `getUserByToken`

#### Description

The `getUserByToken` method is designed to retrieve a user object based on a provided JWT (JSON Web Token). If a valid token is provided, the method decodes the token to extract a user ID, which is then used to fetch the corresponding user and admin data from the database. The method combines the user and admin objects into a merged object, which is then returned. If any step in this process fails (e.g., the token is invalid, the user or admin is not found), an error is logged and a `HajarError` object is thrown.

#### Syntax

```javascript
async getUserByToken(token)
```

#### Parameters

- `token` (String): A JSON Web Token (JWT) used to identify the user.

#### Returns

- If successful, returns an object containing the merged data of the user and admin objects.
- If unsuccessful, throws a `HajarError` object with appropriate error information.

#### Errors

- Throws a `HajarError` with a message of "Invalid user token" if the token is invalid or cannot be verified.
- Throws a `HajarError` with a message of "User not found" if no user is found for the decoded user ID.
- Throws a `HajarError` with a message of "Admin not found" if no admin is found for the user ID.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
const hajarAuth = new HajarAuth(options);
try {
  const userObject = await hajarAuth.getUserByToken(token);
  console.log(userObject);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message);
}
```

#### Detailed Workflow

1. Check if the `token` parameter is provided. If not, return `null`.
2. Try to decode the provided `token` using the `jwt.verify` method, with the secret key stored in the `this.secret` property.
3. Use the `User.findById` method to attempt to find a user with the decoded user ID.
4. Log the decoded user ID for debugging purposes.
5. Use the `Admin.findOne` method to attempt to find an admin with the user ID.
6. If the user or admin is not found, log an error and throw a `HajarError` with appropriate error information.
7. If both the user and admin are found, merge the two objects into a new object and return this merged object.

This method encapsulates the functionality needed to retrieve a user's information based on a provided token, handling errors appropriately to ensure the calling code is informed of any issues that occur during this process.
