## setupMongoDB(`options`, `middleware`)

### Parameters

- `options` (Object): Configuration options for MongoDB. These options typically include a database URL and any additional settings required for the connection.
- `middleware` (Object): The MongoDB middleware or library used for connecting to MongoDB. This can be a library like Mongoose or the native MongoDB driver.

### Returns

The `setupMongoDB` function returns a MongoDB connection object. This object represents the connection to the MongoDB database and allows you to interact with the database.

The MongoDB connection object typically has the following properties and methods:

- `readyState` (Boolean): Indicates the current state of the connection (e.g., connected, disconnected, connecting).
- `close` (Function): A method that can be used to close the MongoDB connection when it is no longer needed.

### Errors

The `setupMongoDB` function may throw an error if an issue occurs during the MongoDB connection setup. In such cases, an `Error` object is thrown with a descriptive error message.

### Example

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

// Configuration options for MongoDB
const mongoDBOptions = {
  url: "mongodb://localhost/mydatabase",
};

try {
  // Set up MongoDB connection using Mongoose middleware
  const mongoDBConnection = setupMongoDB(mongoDBOptions, mongoose);

  // Check the connection state
  if (mongoDBConnection.readyState === mongoose.connection.readyState) {
    console.log("MongoDB connected successfully.");
  } else {
    console.error("MongoDB connection failed.");
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error setting up MongoDB connection:", error.message);
}
```

In this example, the `setupMongoDB` function is used to set up and configure a MongoDB connection using the Mongoose middleware. It checks the connection state and logs whether the MongoDB connection was successful or encountered an error.
