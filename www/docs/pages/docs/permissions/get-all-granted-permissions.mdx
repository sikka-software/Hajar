# `getAllGrantedPermissions`

#### Description

The `getAllGrantedPermissions` method is a member of the `HajarAuth` class. This method is utilized for fetching all distinct grant values from the permissions stored in the database. It provides a unique list of granted permissions, which could be useful in scenarios where you need to list or verify the different grants available in the system.

#### Syntax

```javascript
async getAllGrantedPermissions()
```

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

An array of strings containing distinct grant values. If the operation is successful, it returns an array with the distinct grant values. In case of an error during the operation, a `HajarError` is thrown with a message describing the error and an error code of `"fetch-permission-error"`.

#### Throws

- `HajarError`: If there's an error while fetching the distinct grant values from the database, a `HajarError` object is thrown with an error message describing the failure and a code of `"fetch-permission-error"`.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
const auth = new HajarAuth(options);
try {
  const grants = await auth.getAllGrantedPermissions();
  console.log(grants); // Output: ['grant1', 'grant2', ..., 'grantN']
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message);
}
```

#### Notes

- This method relies on the `Permission` model to interact with the permissions collection in the database.
- The `distinct` method of the `Permission` model is used to obtain unique grant values from the database.
- It's an asynchronous method, so it should be handled with `await` or within a `Promise` chain to ensure proper error handling and function sequencing.
- The `HajarError` class is used for error handling, providing a structured way to catch and handle errors with a consistent error code and message format.
